# XFoil docs

Welcome to the reformatted documentation of XFOIL. 

## Disclaimer

I do not own any of the written documenting text neither the name XFOIL nor the actual program. All
rights of these items go out to Mark Drela (MIT Aero & Astro) and Harold Youngren (Aerocraft, Inc.).

The original, unstyled, documentation from XFOIL can be found in the `original` folder, as well as
via this link: http://web.mit.edu/aeroutil_v1.0/xfoil_doc.txt.

## Motivation

Having become super enthuastic about the possibilities that XFOIL offers, I decided to consult the
manual for this amazing tool. The manual however is a styled plain text format, which does not read
very nicely when consulting it for a long amount of time. Therefore, I figured that it would be nice
to pour the documentation into a nice format. The result of this can be found
[here](https://v0xnihili.github.io/xfoil-docs/).
